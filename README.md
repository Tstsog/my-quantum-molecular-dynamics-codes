# Introduction:

The Matlab codes computes the ground state energy for atoms and molecules using the Car-Parrinello approach in terms of the quantum molecular dynamics method, in which the Hamiltonian, overlapping and two-electron integral are computed by the restricted/unrestricted self-consistent field calculation.  

# Requirement:

Any version of Matlab

# Implementation details and running

You may download and run them.
